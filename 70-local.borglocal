## This is an example borgbackup configuration file.
##
## Here you can find all the possible borgbackup options, details of
## what the options provide and possible settings. The defaults are set
## as the commented out option, uncomment and change when
## necessary. Options which are uncommented in this example do not have
## defaults, and the settings provided are recommended.
## 
## The defaults are useful in most cases, just make sure to configure the 
## destination host and user.
##

## default is 0, but set to 19 if you want to lower the priority.
## an example setting would be:
## nicelevel = 19
##
## Default
# nicelevel = 0

## default is yes. set to no to skip the test if the remote host is alive
##
## Default:
# testconnect = no

## A few notes about includes and excludes:
## 1. include, exclude statements support globbing with '*'
## 2. Symlinks are not dereferenced. Moreover, an include line whose path
##    contains, at any level, a symlink to a directory, will only have the
##    symlink backed-up, not the target directory's content. Yes, you have to
##    dereference yourself the symlinks, or to use 'mount --bind' instead.
##    Example: let's say /home is a symlink to /mnt/crypt/home ; the following
##    line will only backup a "/home" symlink ; neither /home/user nor
##    /home/user/Mail will be backed-up :
##      include = /home/user/Mail
##    A workaround is to 'mount --bind /mnt/crypt/home /home' ; another one is to
##    write :
##      include = /mnt/crypt/home/user/Mail
## 3. All the excludes come after all the includes. The order is not otherwise
##    taken into account.

## files to include in the backup

include = /usr/local/bin
include = /usr/local/sbin
include = /usr/lib/nagios/plugins

# files to exclude from the backup
# (supports globbing with '*')

## destination section
## (where the files are copied to)

[dest]

## put the backups under this directory, this must be set!
## an example setting would be:
## directory = /backups
## 
## Default:
directory = /mnt/borg_usb/

## the machine which will receive the backups.
## an example setting would be:
## host = backuphost
##
## Default
host = localhost

## make the files owned by this user. you must be able to
## `su -c "ssh backupuser@backhost"` without specifying a password.
## an example setting would be:
## user = backupuser
##
## Default:
#user = palantetech-sync

## archive name, should be unique every day.
## Format tags available :
## {now}, {utcnow}, {fqdn}, {hostname}, {user}, {pid}
## for more info see : borg create -h
##
## Default:
archive = {hostname}-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M}


## compression algorithm
## can be "none", "lz4", "zlib", "zlib,0..zlib,9", "lzma", "lzma,0..lzma,9".
## - "none" stands for "no compression"
## - "lz4" is super fast, but low compression
## - "zlib" is less fast, but higher compression
## - "lzma" is even slower, even higher compression
## for more info see : borg create -h
##
## Default:
# compression = lz4
